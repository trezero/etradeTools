# Frontend Error Analysis and Resolution Plan

This document outlines the remaining errors in the frontend application and the proposed solutions for each.

## 1. `ETradeTradeWidget.tsx` and `ETradeWidget.tsx`

*   **Error:** `Block-scoped variable 'checkAuthStatus' used before its declaration.`
*   **Cause:** The `checkAuthStatus` function is being used in a `useEffect` dependency array before it is defined.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Wrap the `checkAuthStatus` function in a `useCallback` hook and import `useCallback` from `react`. This will memoize the function and allow it to be safely used as a dependency.

*   **Error:** `Cannot find name 'useCallback'.`
*   **Cause:** The `useCallback` hook is being used without being imported from `react`.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Add `useCallback` to the import statement from `react`.

*   **Error:** `')' expected.`
*   **Cause:** This is a syntax error that was introduced in my previous, incorrect attempts to fix the file.
*   **Proposed Solution:** I will correct the syntax when I apply the `useCallback` fix.

## 2. `ETradeWidget.tsx`

*   **Error:** `Cannot find name 'useSandbox'.`
*   **Cause:** The `useSandbox` state variable was removed, but a reference to it still exists in the `initiateOAuth` function.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Remove the `use_sandbox` parameter from the API call in the `initiateOAuth` function.

## 3. `PortfolioWidget.tsx`

*   **Error:** `'Position' is defined but never used.`
*   **Cause:** The `Position` type is imported but not used in the component.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Remove the unused `Position` import.

## 4. `WatchlistWidget.tsx`

*   **Error:** `Type ... is not assignable to type ...` for the `color` prop of the `LinearProgress` component.
*   **Cause:** The `getRSIColor` function is returning a value (`"default"`) that is not a valid color for the `LinearProgress` component in the version of Material-UI you are using.
*   **Proposed Solution:** I will modify the `getRSIColor` function to return a valid color. I will change `"default"` to `"primary"`.

## 5. `MarketOverviewWidget.tsx`

*   **Error:** `Property 'item' does not exist on type...`
*   **Cause:** This error is likely due to the Material-UI version mismatch. Now that the packages have been downgraded, this error should be resolved.
*   **Proposed Solution:** I will verify that this error is gone after the other fixes are applied. If it persists, I will address it then.

## 6. Unused Variable Warnings

*   **Error:** Various warnings about unused variables in multiple files.
*   **Cause:** These are leftover from previous development and do not affect the functionality of the application.
*   **Proposed Solution:** I will remove the unused variables to clean up the code and eliminate the warnings.

## Conflicts

After reviewing the proposed fixes, I have identified the following potential conflicts:

1.  **`ETradeTradeWidget.tsx` and `ETradeWidget.tsx`:** The fixes for these two files are very similar. They both involve adding the `useCallback` hook and fixing the `useEffect` dependency array. There is a high probability that if I make a mistake in one file, I will make the same mistake in the other. To mitigate this, I will fix one file completely, verify that it is correct, and then apply the same fix to the other file.

2.  **Material-UI Version:** The fix for the `Grid` component in `MarketOverviewWidget.tsx` is dependent on the Material-UI version. I have already downgraded the packages, so this should not be an issue. However, I will verify that the error is gone after applying the other fixes.

3.  **Unused Variables:** Removing unused variables is a low-risk change, but I will be careful not to remove any variables that are actually being used. I will rely on the ESLint warnings to guide me.
