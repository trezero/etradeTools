# EtradePythonClient Installation Summary

## Installation Progress

We have successfully installed most of the required dependencies for the EtradePythonClient project, but encountered compatibility issues with Python 3.13.2 and some packages, particularly SQLAlchemy.

### Successfully Installed Packages

The following packages were successfully installed in the virtual environment:

- Core packages:
  - pydantic (2.11.9)
  - pydantic-core (2.33.2)
  - pandas (2.3.2)
  - numpy (2.3.3)
  
- Web framework and API:
  - fastapi (0.104.1)
  - uvicorn (0.24.0)
  - websockets (12.0)
  
- Database and ORM:
  - sqlalchemy (2.0.23) - Installed but has compatibility issues with Python 3.13
  - aiosqlite (0.19.0)
  - alembic (1.12.1)
  
- Data validation and serialization:
  - pydantic-settings (2.1.0)

  - pytest-asyncio (0.21.1)
  - httpx (0.25.2)
  
- Development tools:
  - black (23.11.0)
  - flake8 (6.1.0)
  - mypy (1.7.1)
  
- Utilities:
  - python-multipart (0.0.6)
  - python-jose[cryptography] (3.3.0)
  - passlib[bcrypt] (1.7.4)

### Issues Encountered

1. **SQLAlchemy Compatibility**: 
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 has compatibility issues with Python 3.13.2
   - Error: `AssertionError: Class <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.elements.SQLCoreOperations'> directly inherits TypingOnly but has additional attributes {'__static_attributes__', '__firstlineno__'}.`
   - This prevents the application from starting properly

2. **Docker Compose Installation**:
   - Failed to install docker-compose due to PyYAML compilation issues with Python 3.13

3. **Pandas Version Mismatch**:
   - The requirements file specifies pandas==2.1.4, but we installed pandas==2.3.2 due to compatibility issues

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Downgrade Python Version**:
   - The most reliable solution is to use Python 3.10 or 3.11 instead of 3.13.2
   - These versions have better compatibility with the required packages
   - Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10:
     ```bash
     python3.10 -m venv venv310
     source venv310/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
     ```

2. **Use Pre-compiled Wheels**:
   - Continue using `--only-binary=all` flag when installing packages to avoid compilation issues
   - This approach worked for most packages

3. **Wait for Updated Packages**:
   - Some packages may not yet fully support Python 3.13
   - Consider using the project with Python 3.10-3.12 until compatibility is improved

### Next Steps

1. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv310
   source venv310/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install all requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. Test the database functionality:
   ```bash
   python test_database.py
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```

5. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Conclusion

While we made significant progress in installing the required dependencies, Python 3.13.2's newness is causing compatibility issues with some core packages. Downgrading to Python 3.10 or 3.11 would likely resolve these issues and allow the application to run successfully.
